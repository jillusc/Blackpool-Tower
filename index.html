        <div>
          <p>
            Standing tall on the central promenade since 1894, the design of
            this no. 1 attraction was undeniably inspired by the Eiffel Tower in
            Paris.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Blackpool Tower welcomes thousands of visitors each year to
            the archetypal northern English seaside town, promising fun for all
            the family.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            It is home to the grand <span>Tower Ballroom</span> which boasts a
            real Wurlitzer organ and a rich history of hosting dance shows
            beneath 14 ornate chandeliers. [See video below.]
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            At ground level is the <span>Tower Circus</span> where a live band
            provides the shows' dynamic musical accompaniment. The circus has
            never missed a season since beginning in 1894.

            A stunning panoramic view can be experienced from a height of 115m
            via the <span>Blackpool Tower Eye</span> and those who have the
            nerve can stand on a glass viewing platform, the
            <span>SkyWalk</span>, to look down onto the promenade below.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The Blackpool Tower was commissioned in 1890 by Sir John
            Bickerstaffe who was the town's mayor at that time. He had returned
            from the World Trade Fair in Paris a year earlier and was so
            impressed by the sight of the newly unveiled <i>Tour Eiffel</i>,
            decided his beloved hometown should have one of its very own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lancashire architects James Maxwell and and Charles Tuke designed
            the structure but both men had passed away before its completion in
            1894. The construction took four years, using five million bricks
            and more than 2,000 tons of steel and cast iron.
          </p>
          <p>The first visitors paid sixpence to ride the lifts to the top.</p>
          <p>
            A Grade I listed building, the Blackpool Tower stands at 152m tall.
