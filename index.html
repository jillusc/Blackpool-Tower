            Standing tall on the central promenade since 1894, the design of
            this no. 1 attraction was undeniably inspired by the Eiffel Tower in
            Paris. Today, Blackpool Tower welcomes thousands of visitors each
            year to the archetypal northern English seaside town, promising fun
            for all the family.

        <p class="text-layout">
            The Blackpool Tower was commissioned in 1890 by Sir John Bickerstaffe who was
            the town's mayor at that time. He had returned from the World Trade
            Fair in Paris a year earlier and was so impressed by the sight of
            the newly unveiled <i>Tour Eiffel</i>, decided his beloved hometown
            should have one of its very own. <br />
            Lancashire architects James Maxwell and and Charles Tuke designed the structure but both men had passed away before
            its completion in 1894. The construction took four years, using five
            million bricks and more than 2,000 tons of steel and cast iron.  <br />
            The first visitors paid sixpence to ride the lifts to the top. <br />
            A Grade I listed building, the Blackpool Tower stands at 152m tall.</p>
